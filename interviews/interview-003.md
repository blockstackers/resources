*   What’s your role?
    *   I’m one of the core devs. I’ve been involved in design of blockchain, both consensus protocols and smart contract language
    *   I’m most involved in the Clarity language, esp. the implementation of the VM and static analysis patches
    *   Also worked on dev tooling, things like that
    *   Interactions with/relationship to the community
        *   I interact a bit less than other engineers
        *   I reply to GitHub issues, occasionally give talks on the tech
        *   Otherwise not super involved in social consensus/what community wants or needs from the platform
        *   Why? Personal preference. I tend to be less of a large group people person.
        *   I haven’t experienced much negativity online, but I also don’t have much a preference on e.g. Twitter
        *   When we’ve posted articles that were, e.g., critical of various projects I’ve gotten feedback emails from people, but nothing particularly negative
        *   I just have a difficult time interacting with open feedback channels
        *   I tend to try to treat each piece of feedback as “its own micro-emergency” which not conducive to getting a lot of work
*   Who should have a role in protocol governance?
    *   There’s a time-dependency to this answer
    *   The Stacks 2.0 that is launching is something that is very much “a bet and the brainchild of Blockstack PBC"
    *   Once that has hit the network, once people are using it, it “sort of leaves our control"
    *   At that point the stakeholders invested in this chain - not just funds - people that have invested time, energy, etc. - they should all have a say
    *   Does this include anything other than protocol?
        *   No - not treasury management, nor management of funds - that’s up to the possessor of those funds
        *   Deployment of funds managed by Stacks Foundation should be governed by agreement/charter/mandate of the Foundation
*   Who is a stakeholder?
    *   Those who definitely are: those who hold STX tokens, developers of apps that use the Stacks blockchain, users of those apps
        *   Those are primary stakeholders
    *   I take an expansive view of who a stakeholder should be
    *   Ultimate goals of project is to bring a better class of apps to users in general
    *   Viewed through that lens, everyone who is alive today or will ever live is a potential stakeholder
    *   And there is no “blacklist” (of those who are not stakeholders)
*   What are the values of this community/project?
    *   Respecting users’ digital interactions, “digital rights” (we played around with this idea for a while)
    *   That’s the goal of the project - apps that preserve both users’ data privacy, and treats their data, public interactions with a kind of respect
    *   Compare to e.g. Google, which had the “Do no evil” ethos at one point
    *   At Blockstack we want an Internet where that’s fundamental to the protocol - apps can’t be evil with respect to use of user data
    *   That’s the largest shared value
*   What does governance mean to you?
    *   How you resolve conflicts of direction and also how you decide you’ve reached consensus about direction for anything
    *   Primary use case: We want to introduce new functionality to our blockchain - how do you decide whether it should be introduced? How it should be introduced? Who has “veto control” over approving the implementation or whatever?
    *   Other use cases?
        *   There are areas where governance is less critical but could be helpful
        *   Tooling built on top of the protocol - there’s tooling that will have various levels of being blessed by the community
        *   That “blessing” process involves governance
        *   The first question someone will inevitably ask when building an app on blockstack is - what do I need/which library should I use?
        *   This could be community-driven - needs a way to “bless” things
        *   Look at Truffle in Ethereum - it wouldn’t cause a chain split if people used another tool - but if you don’t have a system in place to choose the best tool, it has a negative impact on the DevEx which affects the community
*   What does _good_ governance mean to you?
    *   "A system where stakeholders don’t feel that they need to leave the ecosystem in order to have their voices heard or their issues addressed"
    *   Or if left unaddressed, then they’re small enough issues that they wouldn’t leave the ecosystem
    *   It’s very much related to the impetus to leave. Analogy to real-world government: it’s good if it’s responsive enough that people don’t seek “extra-democratic means for resolving conflicts."
    *   Anything else?
        *   Transparency of decisions - that’s a fundamental tenet of good governance
        *   When a decision is made, even if it’s one you disagree with, you can see how/why it was made, how it was achieved, and the motivation for that decision 
        *   When people think about doing governance in “automated fashion” like on-chain voting it’s somewhat wrongheaded because the important thing is that, when decisions are made, you understand how they’re being made
        *   The trap that people fall into with on-chain voting is that you get an audit trail but it can obscure what’s actually going on in a way that public board votes, etc. don’t obscure
*   How do you get legitimacy/confidence/trust?
    *   Trust and legitimacy are a bit different
    *   Trust is earned through actions: a community trusts you if the things you as a governance platform have been producing, the decisions you’ve been making, "actually reflect the community’s desires"
    *   Legitimacy is kind of like verification that the actual mechanisms of governance are operating correctly - if we have a governance system where we say we have these independent components - Foundation, PBC, representatives of the community - verifying that those mechanisms are actually behaving independently, actually reflecting the stakeholders that they claim to reflect
    *   Confidence is a measure of how confident you are in something else like legitimacy or trust
        *   Can be increased through, e.g., more transparency
        *   I’m placing trust in something, in some process, and I have some degree of confidence that decisions are being made as they say they are
*   Is decentralization of governance the right goal? Why or why not? Is this the right way to do it?
    *   I think it is the right goal because centralization is kind of like a “ticking time bomb” unless maybe there’s other ways of formulating a centralized body
    *   "If a platform is centralized, you’re just waiting until the day that the controller of that centralized body decides that it’s more profitable, that there’s more power to be gained or whatever by exploiting the platform"
    *   "Decentralization can solve that problem by putting more power into the hands of the stakeholders of the platform so that they can ensure that never happens"
    *   There are centralized bodies that don’t suffer from this, e.g., structure of companies that are co-ops: they can avoid this ticking time bomb, but in a sense they are decentralized in their governance too
*   Does this all apply to Blockstack as well?
    *   Sure
    *   The way this becomes important for, e.g., the protocol: centralized apparatuses that support protocol like Blockstack PBC might have finite lifetimes
    *   But if we correctly decentralize the platform, users would be able to continue to support the platform
    *   "The protocol itself by design can hopefully prevent a lot of rent-seeking behavior but that’s not exactly the same as the sort of decentralization concepts that people think about when they think about governance"
*   Is this (i.e., setting up a Foundation) the right way to do it?
    *   (after a long pause) I’m not sure
    *   Determining the “voice of the community” when it comes to the future of the protocol is tricky and I’m not sure I have a ton of insight there
    *   If I’m looking at models outside of the blockchain space, co-ops are perhaps the best model
    *   Usually you have to pay some sort of membership fee, there’s a “verification that you’re a real person,” but there’s a benefit you get from the co-op beyond just a vote. You get, e.g., a membership discount in addition to being able to vote. REI is such a successful co-op. Also, Vanguard. But your vote is “earned by keeping your money with Vanguard."
    *   I think there might be some kernel of an idea there - the “user voice” towards the protocol could through some sort of org. structure that looks like a co-op.
*   How have things worked in the past?
    *   It’s been dictatorial (benevolently)
    *   PBC has functioned as the arbiter regarding the direction of the platform, makes proposals, accepts feedback from the community, takes suggestions though the forum, Discord, etc.
    *   Acts on that feedback, "like the relationship of a king to his subjects"
    *   There have been a couple of cases in which feedback has been integrated
    *   Biggest area of contention so far has been App Mining
        *   There’s been a lot of community engagement and enforcement of the “correct operation of App Mining"
        *   Has a lot to do with transparency of the process
        *   Transparent components, e.g., how scores translated into rankings were continuously checked by the community: there was an incentive to do so because people checking were getting App Mining rewards - there were actually cases of errors being found
    *   In some cases, designs have changed based on community feedback on, e.g., blockstack.JS and the Blockstack browser - they haven’t “radically changed the directions” of proposals but tweaks were made 
*   What’s gone well/not so well?
    *   The changes we’ve made over time have been towards our protocol gradually moving away from reliance on Bitcoin in a lot of ways
        *   We’ve “gradually devolved from Bitcoin"
        *   Each step of that process has been a proposal we submitted to the community, and then we got some feedback on it
        *   These successive steps have gotten less contentious at each step
        *   But in the beginning when we started moving away from BTC, e.g., paying for names using STX instead of BTC, that was fairly contentious
        *   The nature of our community changed a lot - a lot of "big bitcoiners" stopped engaging, and new people came in - this may be why it became less contentious
        *   It worked well in the sense that we are where we are today because of those steps, but at the same time, someone might call it an instance of “governance failure” because we made this decision in spite of some opposition on the part of some of the community
        *   And it was a decision about evolving the platform to something potentially radically different - from various perspectives you could say that’s “not even a matter of governance,” we decided we wanted the platform to be something very different than it was
*   How would you like things to work in the future?
    *   The direction I want to see the platform go is I’d like to see the Stacks 2.0 launch, and run continuously for the indefinite future
    *   The ecosystem, platform, community should mostly be focused on the apps that the community is using
    *   These apps should be as preserving of users’ rights as they claim to be
    *   I’d like to see consensus around what is a good app, and how a good app should run or function, so there’s a “badge of approval” that, e.g., this app is a “digital-rights-preserving app"
    *   I’d like to see that aspect being community-governed
    *   Lane: this is almost like an evolution of App Mining
*   What about App Mining?
    *   I think of App Mining as a funding engine for these apps that we want to exist. I’m less concerned about the mechanisms of that funding than maybe other people.
    *   But I’d like to see these apps get funding maybe in a similar way to how funding works for apps in the “real world” - if it looked like the VC ecosystem, I wouldn’t see that as a failure, even though a lot of people probably would
    *   "They see the blockchain world as a way to 'escape the financial systems we’ve built’ but there’s been 100 years of experience in our financial system for funding"
    *   What is our role here, then?
        *   Someone - the Foundation? - holds the tokens that need to be deployed, to kickstart the process
        *   We have capital set aside specifically for doing this
        *   There’s a role for the Foundation but it could be as limited as saying “these 35 orgs, each gets 1M STX, each one signs some charter or something that they’re going to use these funds for the purpose of kickstarting an app ecosystem"
*   How do we govern the Foundation? E.g. directors, to whom should it be accountable?
    *   Depends partially on its powers
    *   You should have a board member that represents community in some way
    *   And a board member that represents the developers in some way
    *   If you look at how European company boards tend to work, they tend to have a board member that’s a union representative
    *   In the USA we tend to think of unions as a “counterbalance to boards” - it’s different in Europe
